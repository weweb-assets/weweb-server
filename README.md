# weweb-server

## Prerequisite

You will need a WeWeb subscription to have access to this server and to be able to configure it.
Contact WeWeb team to subscribe to the "Self-Hosting" plan at [https://www.weweb.io](https://www.weweb.io).

## Principle

`weweb-server` will be the entry point of you self-hosted WeWeb project : it will manage Authentication, pages accesses and file serve for one or multiple of your WeWeb projects.

`weweb-server` needs to be connected to a Postgres Database that you will also have to host.
We advise you to add a CDN in front of this server to keep some files in cache.

`weweb-server` needs some storage to retreive your projects' files. This storage can be local, distant or an AWS S3 bucket.

Each time you publish a new version of one of your projects, you will need to update the project's files and configure the server's DB info using WeWeb's Dashboard (The configure button can be found in the project's Dashboard > Self-Hosting > Configure WeWeb Server)

> Note : `weweb-server` needs to be accessible from our servers so that we can send some configuration data to it each time you publish a project.

## Database

You need to create a new Postgres Database that will be used by this server to store some non sensible data about your projects' pages (private accesses, user groups and a list of all pages).
You will need to set some environment variables in `weweb-server` for it to be able to connect to the Database.

## Storage

You will need some storage to put your projects' files on it.

This storage can be :

-   Local to weweb-server (add a folder in the server)
-   Distant (in some http url)
-   AWS S3 Bucket (the bucket doesn't need to be dedicated to this storage)

The storage location is configured using environment variables.

## Environment variables

> -   `:filesVersion`
>
> Ex: `./projects/:projectId/:filesVersion` will fetch the frontend project's files localy.
> FILES_PATH should end without a `/` .

> #### SERVER_PATH :

## Publish a new version of a project

1.  Publish your project on WeWeb Dashboard and wait for it to finish
2.  Go to your project's Dashboard > Self-Hosting and download the project's ZIP archive
3.  Unzip the archive in your storage. We advise you to use subfolders for each projects and each versions of your projects to prevent downtime.
4.  Go to your project's Dashboard > Self-Hosting and click on Configure WeWeb Server

The new version of your project is now live !

## Updating `weweb-server`

TBD

# WeWeb Public API

WeWeb Public API allows you to automate deployements on your weweb-server.

WeWeb Public API has a rate limit of 3 calls per seconds and will return `429 Too many requests error` if the limit is hit.

## Access to WeWeb Public API

Please contact the WeWeb team to get access to WeWeb Public API.

Currently, access to WeWeb Public API is also granted if you have access to the self-hosting feature.

## Beaking changes in last update

Some breaking changes have been introduced in the latest version of the API.

Check the [Breaking changes](#breaking-changes) section to know more.

## Authentication

WeWeb Public API authentication is done using an `Authorization` header in every requests.

The value of this header should be `Bearer <YOUR WORKSPACE PRIVATE KEY>`.

Your workspace Private Key can be found under the `Settings` tab in your workspace.

You can generate a new Private Key at any time but this will invalidate the old one.

> Example :
> `headers: {"Authorization": "Bearer WW-PRIVATE-XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"}`

 7. Save the downloaded ZIP file
 8. Extract the download zip file to your weweb-server storage at the right place (defined by FILES_PATH)

## Breaking changes

### The last version of the publication changed some configuration in the Public API

-   The endpoint to start a publication has been updated and its parameters has been modified :
    -   New parameter : `builtZip` - BOOLEAN - set to `true` if you need the publication to generate a zip with the built files.
    -   New parameter : `rawZip` - BOOLEAN - set to `true` if you need the publication to generate a zip with the raw files.
    -   New parameter : `githubEnabled` - BOOLEAN - set to `true` if you need the publication tu push the raw files to a connected Github repository.
    -   Removed data from response : `progress` is not present anymore in the result of the publish endpoint.
-   The endpoint to monitor a publication has been updated and it's return value has been modified :
    -   Removed data from response : `progress` is not present anymore in the result of the publish endpoint. 
        -   To know when a publication is done you have to monitor `status` in the response. Its value should be `deployed` when the publication is done.
-   The endpoint to generate the built ZIP has been deleted as it is no more useful. 
-   The endpoint to get the built ZIP generation has been deleted as it is no more useful.
